# <Work-Day-Scheduler>

## Description

I created this page to allow a space to save and use a day calander for easier access and usage for everyone to setup their day. The motivation was to use this as a study planner to give myself a rough idea of how to use the time in the day. Making this solved the issue of time managment for me as I can now plan my day out accordingly on this website. It allowed me to learn how to use JS and append data onto a html file as well as using moment.js and how to familairze myself with JS and third-party APIS

## Installation

Just use linked url to access on a browser

## Usage

Navigate to the webapage and add to time and save to use.
